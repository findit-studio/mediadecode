//! Decoder traits — push-style streams (FFmpeg / WebCodecs / ProRes
//! RAW via VTDecompressionSession), pull-style frame sources
//! (R3D / BRAW / ARRIRAW / X-OCN / Canon RAW Light), and the one-shot
//! [`ImageDecoder`].
//!
//! # What the names say
//!
//! `Stream` in a name means the decoder has a *rhythm*: packets go in
//! over time, frames come out over time, and the two are not in step —
//! hence `send_packet` / `receive_frame` / `send_eof` / `flush`.
//! [`VideoStreamDecoder`] and [`AudioStreamDecoder`] carry it.
//! [`SubtitleDecoder`] and [`ImageDecoder`] do not, and their names say
//! so: a subtitle cue and a still image each come out of exactly the
//! packet that went in.
//!
//! All four are mirrored under [`crate::future`] with `async fn`
//! methods, in both the `!Send` and the `Send`-bounded variant.
//!
//! # What the two calls answer
//!
//! Every `send_packet` / `send_eof` here answers [`Sent`] — *accepted*
//! or *must drain* — and every `receive_frame` answers [`Received`] —
//! *a frame*, *needs input*, or *ended*. `Err` is reserved for faults
//! on both faces. The rationale, and the reason those two vocabularies
//! are exhaustive while the backends' error types are not, is on the
//! [`rhythm`](crate::rhythm) module.
//!
//! # The buffer seat
//!
//! Every trait here carries a `Buffer` associated type bounded only by
//! `AsRef<[u8]>`, and none of them names a concrete carrier. What a
//! backend may bind there is the
//! [D-seat amputation contract](crate::adapter#the-d-seat-amputation-contract):
//! owned, `Send + Sync`, clone-is-a-refcount-bump, with no
//! backend-internal lifetime crossing the seam.
//!
//! # Construction is not on these traits
//!
//! Opening a decoder is each backend's own business and each
//! backend's is different — codec parameters, a WebCodecs config
//! dictionary, a clip handle. Putting a constructor on the trait would
//! force one of those spellings onto all of them, which is the same
//! stance [`crate::demuxer::Demuxer`] takes for the same reason.
