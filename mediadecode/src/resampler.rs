//! The resample seam — sample-rate, sample-format and channel-layout
//! conversion for decoded audio.
//!
//! Every consumer downstream of a decoder wants audio in *its* shape,
//! and the shapes disagree: speech models want 16 kHz mono, audio-event
//! and music models want 48 kHz, a mixer wants whatever the graph runs
//! at. The decoder produces whatever the file holds. [`AudioResampler`]
//! is the seam between them.
//!
//! The face is the [`AudioStreamDecoder`] push pair, one tier along:
//! `send_frame` / `receive_frame` / `send_eof` / `flush`, answering the
//! same [`Sent`] and [`Received`] the decoders answer. One rhythm for
//! the whole chain: the caller pushes, drains, and schedules.
//!
//! No FFmpeg in the shape. `swresample` is merely the first
//! implementation; a pure-Rust polyphase resampler fits the same face.
//!

/// Push-style audio resampler: rate, sample format, and channel layout
/// conversion.
///
/// # Both specs are explicit at construction
///
/// An implementation is built knowing **both** ends: the source spec —
/// the rate, sample format and channel layout the frames coming in will
/// carry, which the caller reads off the track's
/// [`TrackInfo`](crate::demuxer::TrackInfo) — and the target spec,
/// which is the caller's own. The target is never a constant baked into
/// the seam: one consumer wants 16 kHz mono and the next wants 48 kHz
/// stereo, from the same file, at the same time. It is options.
///
/// Construction is therefore not on this trait, for the same reason it
/// is not on the decoder traits: each backend takes its own spelling of
/// those two specs.
///
/// # A mid-stream format change is a named refusal
///
/// If a frame arrives whose rate, sample format or channel layout is
/// not the source spec the implementation was built with,
/// [`send_frame`](Self::send_frame) **fails with a named error**. It
/// does not silently reconfigure. Silent reconfiguration would resample
/// the two halves of a stream on different terms and hand the caller a
/// single unbroken timeline built out of them, with nothing in the
/// output saying so. Refusing hands the decision back up: the caller
/// rebuilds the resampler for the new source spec, and the seam in the
/// data has a seam in the code to match.
///
/// # EOF drains the conversion tail
///
/// A rate converter holds samples back: its filter needs future input
/// to produce present output, so at any moment some tens of
/// milliseconds are inside it and not yet out. [`send_eof`](Self::send_eof)
/// followed by [`receive_frame`](Self::receive_frame) drains them.
/// Skipping the drain loses the end of every file.
///
/// The tail has an end and [`receive_frame`](Self::receive_frame) names
/// it: [`Received::Ended`] once the delay line is empty, never
/// [`Received::NeedsInput`]. The distinction is the whole reason a
/// drain loop can be written without the caller remembering whether it
/// called `send_eof` — one answer means *feed me*, the other means
/// *stop*, and a resampler that says the first when it means the second
/// is an infinite loop nothing in the caller can detect.
///
/// Output timestamps are kept by **delay-compensated accounting**: the
/// output timeline is anchored on the first input timestamp and then
/// advanced by the number of samples actually produced, so the frames
/// drained after EOF continue the same timeline rather than restarting
/// or repeating it.
