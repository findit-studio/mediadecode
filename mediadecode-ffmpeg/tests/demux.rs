//! The demux tier's contracts, pinned against real containers.
//!
//! Every lane here reads a file. The media is generated at run time —
//! see `support/mod.rs` for why the committed corpus cannot serve these
//! shapes — and each lane returns early with a printed reason when the
//! `ffmpeg` CLI that generates it is absent.
//!
//! What is pinned:
//!
//! - the five track kinds map to the five delivery arms, cover art
//!   landing on `Attachment` rather than `Video`;
//! - packets arrive in interleaved file order, compared against a bare
//!   `av_read_frame` loop over the same file rather than a hand-written
//!   expectation;
//! - an attachment track delivers exactly one packet, before any timed
//!   packet, whether its payload is synthesized from codec extradata (a
//!   font) or hoisted out of `AVStream.attached_pic` (cover art) — and
//!   in the cover-art case the duplicate the container *also* emits is
//!   dropped;
//! - a seek lands on a keyframe at or before the target, and replays no
//!   attachment;
//! - `None` means EOF and stays meaning it;
//! - timestamps carry their track's timebase, not a placeholder;
//! - reading the track table costs no packet, whenever it is read;
//! - a container's chapter table reaches the session with the
//!   container's own ids, its own timebase and its titles — and a file
//!   that declares none answers an empty table;
//! - a chapter whose declared timebase is not one is refused **by
//!   name**, never by panic, and the chapter table is bounded and
//!   fallibly allocated before a byte of it is reserved;
//! - a container states its own length, and a track it states none for
//!   stays `None` — the container's figure is never copied onto a row;
//! - the container's duration says how libavformat came by it: stated
//!   by headers, probed from packet timestamps, or estimated from a
//!   bitrate;
//! - a walk to end of file measures each track's end exactly, a walk
//!   that stopped early says its figure is only the one so far, and a
//!   seek or a dropped packet means the figure is never called final.
