//! Test media for the demux and resample lanes, generated at run time.
//!
//! # Why generated and not committed
//!
//! This repository already carries a media corpus: the `audio-fixtures`
//! submodule under `tests/fixtures/audio`, which
//! `tests/audio_pcm_fixtures.rs` sweeps end to end. It is 16 kHz mono
//! WAV throughout. Nothing in it has a second track, a subtitle, a
//! font, cover art, a timecode stream, or a sample rate worth
//! converting *from* — so it can prove a decoder and cannot prove
//! either of the contracts this file's consumers are about.
//!
//! Those shapes are therefore made here, with the `ffmpeg` CLI, into a
//! temp directory that goes away with the run. Nothing binary is
//! committed, and the recipe is readable beside the assertions it
//! feeds.
//!
//! # When the CLI is absent
//!
//! [`Corpus::new`] returns `None` after printing why, and every lane
//! that needs generated media returns early — the same welcome the
//! submodule sweep extends to a contributor who has not run
//! `git submodule update --init`. Lanes that need no media (the seek
//! arithmetic, the mid-stream refusal) run regardless.
