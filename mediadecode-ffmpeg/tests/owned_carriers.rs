//! The 0.9 amputation, pinned from outside the crate.
//!
//! Everything here reads only the public API, which is the point: the
//! [D-seat amputation contract][law] is a promise made to a *consumer*,
//! and a consumer cannot see `pub(crate)` helpers or unit-test
//! internals. If a future release reintroduces a carrier that borrows
//! from libavcodec, these lanes stop compiling.
//!
//! What is pinned:
//!
//! - every frame and packet form this crate emits is `Send + Sync +
//!   Clone + 'static` — the four properties a graph needs to fan a
//!   message out, and the four an `AVBufferRef` view cannot all give;
//! - a decoded frame outlives the decoder that produced it, and its
//!   bytes survive the demuxer being dropped;
//! - side data rides an `Arc` and clones by refcount, not by copy;
//! - the one-shot `ImageDecoder` turns a real container's cover art
//!   back into pixels, and reads a still's EXIF orientation off the
//!   display matrix libavcodec really emits for it.
//!
//! Media is generated at run time — see `support/mod.rs` for why the
//! committed corpus cannot serve these shapes — and each lane that
//! needs it returns early with a printed reason when the `ffmpeg` CLI
//! is absent.
