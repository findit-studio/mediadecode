//! **Nothing allocates after the budget charge.**
//!
//! A container's metadata values are attacker-sized, so the demuxer
//! measures one, charges it against a budget, and only then builds it.
//! That chain is worth nothing if the last step allocates again — and
//! it used to: the carrier was a `SmolStr`, whose constructor takes a
//! `&str` and copies into a fresh `Arc<str>` past 23 bytes. A second,
//! **infallible** allocation of an attacker-sized value, made while the
//! fallibly reserved buffer was still live, so failing it aborted the
//! process the budget existed to keep alive.
//!
//! The carrier is `smol_bytes::Utf8Bytes` now, and this file is the
//! proof rather than the claim: a counting global allocator watches the
//! conversion itself.
//!
//! The carrier lanes need no `ffmpeg` CLI and no fixture — they
//! exercise the conversion directly, which is the step under test. The
//! last lane opens a real container and watches the whole admission
//! transaction, which does need one, and returns early with the
//! corpus's own printed reason where it is absent.
