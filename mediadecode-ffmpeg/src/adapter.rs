//! `Ffmpeg` adapter — implements [`mediadecode::VideoAdapter`],
//! [`mediadecode::AudioAdapter`], [`mediadecode::SubtitleAdapter`],
//! [`mediadecode::adapter::ImageAdapter`] and
//! [`mediadecode::demuxer::DemuxAdapter`] for this crate.
//!
//! The adapter is a zero-sized type whose sole purpose is to bind the
//! associated types together so the rest of the API (Packet / Frame /
//! Decoder) reads cleanly: `VideoPacket<Ffmpeg, FfmpegBytes>` etc.
//!
//! `DemuxAdapter` bundles the other three, and `Ffmpeg` fills all four
//! seats with itself — the demux tier's `CodecId` bound (one
//! codec-identifier namespace across a container's whole track table) is
//! trivially satisfied when every family already binds
//! [`crate::CodecId`].

  // `AVStream.metadata` hands out borrowed `&str` that dies with the

  // **`Utf8Bytes`, and the reason is allocation failure rather than
  // size.** A metadata value is read out of a container, so its length
  // is attacker-controlled; the demuxer therefore measures it, charges
  // it against a budget, and builds it in a `String` reserved with
  // `try_reserve_exact`, so exhaustion is a named error rather than an
  // abort.
  //
  // That whole chain is only worth anything if the last step — handing
  // the buffer to this carrier — allocates nothing more. `SmolStr` sat
  // here before and could not: its constructor takes a `&str` and
  // copies into a fresh `Arc<str>` for anything past 23 bytes, so a
  // second, infallible allocation of an attacker-sized value happened
  // *after* the fallible one, with the first still live. Failing there
  // aborted the process, which is exactly what the budget existed to
  // prevent.
  //
  // `Utf8Bytes::from(String)` **moves** the buffer instead: short
  // values go inline (`smol_bytes::INLINE_CAP`, no allocation at all)
  // and longer ones reach `bytes::Bytes::from(Vec<u8>)`, which takes
  // the vector's own allocation over rather than copying it. See
  // `demuxer::lossy_text` for the one residue that remains and why it
  // is not attacker-scaled.
  //
  // It is also the carrier every text seat in this household is
  // supposed to be on.
