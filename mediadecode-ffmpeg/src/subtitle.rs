//! `mediadecode::SubtitleDecoder` impl backed by
//! `ffmpeg::decoder::Subtitle`.
//!
//! Subtitles use FFmpeg's legacy synchronous `decode()` API rather
//! than `send_packet`/`receive_frame`. We bridge the difference by
//! converting the produced `AVSubtitle` into a
//! [`mediadecode::SubtitleFrame`] inside [`SubtitleDecoder::send_packet`]
//! and stashing it in `pending` for the next [`SubtitleDecoder::receive_frame`]
//! call. This matches the trait's contract: `send_packet` enqueues
//! work — answering [`Sent::MustDrain`] while the seat is still full,
//! since the inline API cannot queue a second cue — and `receive_frame`
//! drains one decoded frame at a time, answering
//! [`Received::NeedsInput`] when the seat is empty and
//! [`Received::Ended`] once [`SubtitleDecoder::send_eof`] has been
//! signalled.
//!
//! **A decoder with no tail still has an end.** `avcodec_decode_subtitle2`
//! produces its cue inline, so nothing is buffered and `send_eof` has
//! nothing to flush — but a session the caller has declared over is a
//! different state from one still waiting for packets, and only one of
//! them lets a drain loop stop. The latch that tells them apart is the
//! whole of this backend's end-of-stream machinery.
