//! `FfmpegBuffer` — the **view** lane's carrier.
//!
//! A refcounted handle onto an `AVBufferRef` that FFmpeg already owns.
//! Cloning bumps the refcount; dropping releases one reference; the
//! bytes are never copied. This is the carrier 0.8 shipped, resurrected
//! by ruling as the second of two first-class lanes — see
//! [the carrier lanes][lanes] for what each one is for.
//!
//! # What the amputation round taught this type
//!
//! The view lane is not 0.8 restored unchanged. Every lesson from the
//! 0.9 review loop that lands on *this* type has been re-applied:
//!
//! * **The extent is proved before a view exists.** 0.8 formed a view
//!   over a packet's claimed range and let a malformed `size` hand out
//!   a slice nobody had checked. The proof now runs first, in
//!   [`crate::buffer::payload_of`], which both lanes share — so the
//!   view lane cannot regress it independently.
//! * **`AV_PKT_FLAG_TRUSTED` is refused on both legs**, and for a
//!   sharper reason here than on the owned lane: a payload that is a
//!   structure of pointers is uncarriable when copied, and *equally*
//!   uncarriable when viewed. Sharing the allocation does not make its
//!   pointers own what they name.
//! * **Budgets judge sizes, not copies.** A view costs no bytes, but a
//!   ceiling on frame and packet size is a ceiling on what a caller
//!   will be handed and asked to hold — so every seat that fires on
//!   the owned lane fires identically here.
//! * **Every constructor that takes an extent is crate-private**, and
//!   the one that takes row geometry checks it rather than asserting
//!   it. An invariant that lives in the caller is an invariant the
//!   caller has to be inside this crate to be trusted with.
//! * **A shared buffer never reaches a caller as something mutable.**
//!   The zero-copy send exists, but it is scoped to a decoder
//!   submission inside this crate; a packet a caller *holds* owns its
//!   bytes. See [the boundary's `with_ffmpeg_video_packet`][scoped].
//! * **What may be read past a carrier is recorded, not inferred.**
//!   Trailing capacity is not padding — see [`Origin`].
