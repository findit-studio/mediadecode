//! Two kinds of test need their own process. One is a fault switch that
//! is **global**: `av_max_alloc` makes every FFmpeg allocation past a
//! size fail, which is the only honest way to test an out-of-memory
//! path against the real library — and it would break every other lane
//! running beside it. The other is a failure whose whole point is that
//! it *used* to end the process: a test that asserts the process
//! survives has to be able to observe a process that did not.
//!
//! [`in_subprocess`] re-runs one named test in a child of the test
//! binary itself, single-threaded and alone, and the parent asserts the
//! child exited normally. A child that aborts is reported as the
//! signal it died of rather than as a passing test.

/// Runs `body` in a child process running only this test, and asserts
/// the child exited cleanly.

/// `test_path` must be the test's name as libtest spells it — the
/// module path inside the crate, e.g. `demuxer::tests::the_lane` — so
/// that `--exact` selects exactly this test in the child.
