//! `mediadecode::AudioStreamDecoder` impl backed by
//! `ffmpeg::decoder::Audio`.
//!
//! Mirrors the shape of [`crate::FfmpegVideoStreamDecoder`] without
//! the HW-fallback wrinkle — audio decoders never go through a
//! hardware backend in the FFmpeg world, so there's no probe, no
//! state machine, just `send_packet` / `receive_frame` over the
//! software decoder.
//!
//! Frames produced via [`crate::convert::av_frame_to_audio_frame`]
//! carry `FfmpegBytes` planes copied out of the source `AVFrame` — the
//! [D-seat amputation contract][law]. The consumer can hold the frame
//! across decoder calls, send it to another thread, and outlive the
//! decoder that made it.
