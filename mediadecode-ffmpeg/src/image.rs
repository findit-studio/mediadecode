//! [`mediadecode::decoder::ImageDecoder`] impl backed by
//! `libavcodec` — the cover-art road.
//!
//! A container's still images are not video, and this crate's demux
//! tier already says so: a video-shaped stream carrying
//! `AV_DISPOSITION_ATTACHED_PIC` is reclassified to
//! [`TrackKind::Attachment`](mediadecode::demuxer::TrackKind::Attachment),
//! and its one packet — the picture, whole — is queued at open. What
//! was missing was the other half: something to turn those bytes back
//! into pixels.
//!
//! # The codec identity survives the reclassification
//!
//! Nothing about the reclassification loses the picture's codec.
//! [`TrackParams::Attachment`](mediadecode::demuxer::TrackParams::Attachment)
//! carries the `AVCodecParameters.codec_id` the stream declared
//! (`mjpeg`, `png`, `bmp`, …), and
//! [`TrackExtra`](crate::extras::TrackExtra) carries a deep,
//! checked copy of the whole `AVCodecParameters` — width, height,
//! pixel format and extradata included. Those parameters are exactly
//! what [`FfmpegImageDecoder::open`] wants, so the road from a track
//! row to a decoded picture has no gap in it:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use mediadecode::{
//!   decoder::ImageDecoder,
//!   demuxer::{Demuxer, DemuxedPacket, TrackKind},
//! };
//! use mediadecode_ffmpeg::{FfmpegOwnedDemuxer, FfmpegOwnedImageDecoder, DecoderLimits};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // The owned lane: this decoder takes owned attachments, and a
//! // cover is a picture a caller usually keeps.
//! let mut demuxer = FfmpegOwnedDemuxer::open("song.mp3")?;
//! let cover_track = demuxer
//!   .tracks()
//!   .iter()
//!   .position(|t| t.kind() == TrackKind::Attachment)
//!   .expect("this file has cover art");
//! let parameters = demuxer.tracks()[cover_track].extra().clone_parameters()?;
//!
//! while let Some(packet) = demuxer.next_packet()? {
//!   if let DemuxedPacket::Attachment(attachment) = packet {
//!     let mut decoder = FfmpegOwnedImageDecoder::open(parameters, DecoderLimits::default())?;
//!     let image = decoder.decode(attachment.packet())?;
//!     println!("{}x{}", image.width(), image.height());
//!     break;
//!   }
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # One shot, and the decoder stays open
//!
//! [`ImageDecoder::decode`] takes a packet and answers a picture; there
//! is no `send` / `receive` split, because an attachment track's
//! contract is exactly one packet and a still codec's answer to it is
//! exactly one frame. The `AVCodecContext` is nonetheless kept and
//! reset between calls rather than reopened: a container with a dozen
//! cover images (Matroska attachments, timed thumbnails exported by
//! hand) decodes them through one decoder.
