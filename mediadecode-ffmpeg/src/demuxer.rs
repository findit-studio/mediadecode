//! [`mediadecode::demuxer::Demuxer`] impl backed by `libavformat`.
//!
//! Opens a container — from a path, or from any `Read + Seek` reader
//! through a custom `AVIOContext` — builds its track table once, and
//! then hands packets out one at a time in interleaved file order.
//!
//! The table is built at open and **kept for the life of the session**:
//! it is what every packet is classified against, so reading it takes
//! nothing away and may happen at any point. Rows are handed out as
//! `triomphe::Arc<TrackInfo<Ffmpeg>>` handles — see
//! [`Demuxer::TrackHandle`](mediadecode::demuxer::Demuxer::TrackHandle).
//!
//! A container's **table of contents** is read at that same moment and
//! kept the same way: `AVFormatContext.chapters`, mirrored into
//! [`Chapter`] rows and answered by
//! [`Demuxer::chapters`](mediadecode::demuxer::Demuxer::chapters). See
//! [`build_chapters`] for what is read, what is bounded before it is
//! allocated, and what is deliberately left as the container wrote it.
//!
//! # What normalization this layer does
//!
//! libavformat's track table is not quite the one the demux tier
//! promises, and the gap is entirely about attachments:
//!
//! - **Cover art is an attachment, not video.** A still image in an
//!   MP3, FLAC or MP4 arrives as a video stream carrying
//!   `AV_DISPOSITION_ATTACHED_PIC`. This layer maps it to
//!   [`TrackKind::Attachment`], so the `Video` arm carries true motion
//!   video and nothing else.
//! - **A font's bytes are not in the packet stream at all.** An
//!   `AVMEDIA_TYPE_ATTACHMENT` stream never produces a packet; its
//!   payload lives in `AVCodecParameters.extradata`. This layer
//!   synthesizes the packet at open time.
//! - **Cover art's packet is hoisted.** libavformat parks the real
//!   packet in `AVStream.attached_pic`; some demuxers also emit it in
//!   the packet stream, some do not. This layer takes it from
//!   `attached_pic` at open time and drops the duplicate if it ever
//!   arrives, so the count is exactly one either way.
//!
//! Both kinds are queued at open — every attachment track, without
//! exception, or the open fails. That is what makes the face's "exactly
//! one packet, before any timed packet" true *by construction* here:
//! the queue is complete and drains before the first `av_read_frame`
//! call ever runs, so no packet on an attachment track can be anything
//! but a duplicate, and no seek can move a packet that was never on the
//! timeline.
//!
//! # Seeking
//!
//! `seek` converts the target to `AV_TIME_BASE` units and calls
//! `avformat_seek_file` over the window `[i64::MIN, target]`, which is
//! FFmpeg's backward convention: the landing point is the nearest
//! keyframe at or before the target, never after. `avformat_seek_file`
//! flushes libavformat's own buffers; this layer clears the EOF latch
//! it set itself, and deliberately does **not** touch the attachment
//! bookkeeping — an attachment already handed out is never handed out
//! again, and one not yet handed out is still owed.

/// before asking whether it was allowed to. A file declaring a gigabyte

/// was too much.
///
/// The fix is not a check moved a few lines earlier: any per-track

/// So the whole file is admitted here, in a pass that allocates
/// nothing — it reads two integers per stream — and only a container
/// that passes in full reaches the loop that builds carriers and
/// parameter copies.
///
/// # Why it is every stream, not every attachment
///
/// Because the track table copies **every** stream's codec parameters,
/// and `AVCodecParameters` reaches the heap three ways — `extradata`,
/// every `coded_side_data` entry, a custom channel map — all of them
/// sized by the file. A pass that walked only attachment streams left
/// the other road wide open: a MOV puts an ICC profile in
/// `coded_side_data`, on an ordinary video track, and the wholesale
/// copy took it before anything asked how big it was. That was the same
/// class of defect three review rounds running, which is why the copy
/// itself is gone (see
/// [`bounded_clone_parameters`](crate::extras::bounded_clone_parameters))
/// and why this pass sees everything.
///
/// # What is charged
///
/// The bytes this session will **retain**, which is not always the
/// declared size:
///
/// - every stream is charged its parameter clone's footprint against
///   the per-stream and whole-file codec-parameter budgets;
/// - a synthesized attachment's `extradata` is charged to the
///   *attachment* budget and left out of the parameter one, because the
///   clone strips it and the carrier holds it — one set of bytes, one
///   charge;
/// - the attachment budgets then see:
///
/// - a hoisted cover-art track retains its parked `AVPacket`'s payload
///   *and* the extradata in its parameter copy, which the still decoder
///   may need and which is not a duplicate of the payload;
/// - a synthesized `AVMEDIA_TYPE_ATTACHMENT` track retains only the
///   carrier, because `build_tracks` strips the duplicate extradata out
///   of the parameter copy (see the comment there for the census).
///
/// Charging residency rather than payload is what keeps the budget an
/// honest statement about memory instead of about file structure.
///
/// The per-attachment ceiling is judged first for each track: when a
/// single payload is itself over the line, that is the more specific
