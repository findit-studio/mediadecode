  // (and has been since FFmpeg 4.0), so it is set directly rather than
  // through `av_opt_set_int` and a stringly-typed option name.
  //
  // **And the byte ceiling, pushed down through the same field.**
  //
  // The pixel ceiling alone does not bound bytes, because a pixel is not
  // a fixed price: 10000x10000 is 100 Mpx — comfortably under the 256
  // Mpx default — and in `rgba64` it is 800 MB, well over the 512 MiB
  // byte ceiling. A highly compressible frame of that shape is a few KB
  // on disk, so nothing upstream sees it coming.
  //
  // **`max_pixels` carries the caller's number, verbatim.** It used to
  // carry `min(that, max_frame_bytes / worst-bytes-per-pixel)`, so the
  // byte ceiling could be enforced before libavcodec allocated — and
  // that translation charged every stream the widest format in
  // existence, 16 bytes a pixel. A 1920x1080 `yuv420p` frame costs
  // 3.14 MiB and was refused under a 4 MiB budget, at
  // `ff_set_dimensions`, before anything accurate had a chance to look
  // at it. Over-refusing ordinary video is not a conservative failure;
  // it is a broken decoder.
  //
  // The translation is gone because it is no longer needed: the byte
  // ceiling is enforced by [`judge_buffer`], which is *also* a
  // pre-allocation seat — `get_buffer2` is the allocator, so it runs
  // before the allocation and prices the frame's real format at its
  // real aligned dimensions. Nothing is lost on the software road by
