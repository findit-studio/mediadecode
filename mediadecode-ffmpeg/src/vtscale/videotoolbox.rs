/// strands nothing of theirs. The three that remain are the three
/// below. A later FFmpeg marking a *whitelisted* kind size-dependent

/// on a symbol half the supported releases do not have.
///
/// # What else counts as forbidding, and what this walk trusts
///
/// Three shapes of side-data bookkeeping are refused before the array
/// is ever indexed, because each is a value the `c_int` field can hold
/// that a real array provably cannot back: a **negative** count, a
/// **positive count with a null array**, and a count past
/// [`crate::decoder::HW_COPY_SIDE_DATA_MAX_ENTRIES`] — the cap the copy
/// path itself truncates at, past which this walk could not tell
/// whether a size-dependent entry sat in the part that gets dropped. A
/// **null entry** found inside the array is refused too, on the same
/// reasoning, from inside the walk.
///
/// What is left is trusted, and the trust is worth naming: within those
/// bounds this reads `nb_side_data` as the true length of the
/// `side_data` array. **There is no second source for that length** —
/// `AVFrame` publishes the count and the pointer and nothing that could
/// corroborate them — so a count that is positive, within the cap, and
/// larger than the array FFmpeg actually allocated cannot be detected
/// by any amount of care here, and this walk would read past the end.
/// That is exactly the trust
/// [`crate::decoder::copy_frame_props_minimal`] and its byte-summing
/// neighbour already place in the same two fields on every frame this
/// crate transfers, and it is libavutil's own invariant to keep: the
/// pair is written together by `av_frame_new_side_data` and cleared
/// together by `av_frame_unref`. This stage does not widen that
/// boundary; it walks a **shorter** prefix of the same array than the
/// copy that follows it.
///
/// # Safety
/// `frame` must be a live `*const AVFrame`. Reads `nb_side_data`, the
/// `side_data` pointer array, and each entry's `type_` as the `c_int`
/// it is — no `AVFrameSideDataType` is ever materialised from FFmpeg
/// memory, which is the same enum-from-integer law the rest of this
/// crate keeps.
