//! The stage's other body: the same seat, answering that it cannot
//! fill it.
//!
//! Reached on every target [`crate::vtscale`]'s gate turns away — a
//! non-Apple target, or an Apple one whose availability window Rust
//! cannot express (iOS, tvOS, watchOS) — and on any build that asked
//! for the stage to be compiled out.
//!
//! `VTPixelTransferSession` is VideoToolbox, so this stage exists only
//! on Apple targets. The other three backends this crate wires —
//! [`crate::Backend::Vaapi`], [`crate::Backend::Cuda`],
//! [`crate::Backend::D3d11va`] — each have a native scaling seam of
//! their own (VAAPI's VPP,
//! [#57](https://github.com/findit-studio/mediadecode/issues/57);
//! NVDEC/CUVID in-decode scaling,
//! [#56](https://github.com/findit-studio/mediadecode/issues/56); the
//! D3D11 Video Processor,
//! [#58](https://github.com/findit-studio/mediadecode/issues/58)), and
//! each is filed rather than fabricated here. Until one of them lands,
//! this body keeps the answer honest: `Unsupported`, on a road that
//! delivers full-size pictures and says so.
