//! The request seat's answer, on whichever target these run on.

//! Deliberately the *only* thing tested here: the stage's arithmetic
//! moved into `videotoolbox/tests.rs` alongside the body that owns it,
//! so a build without a stage carries neither the code nor a test for
//! it. What every build does carry is this seat, and what it must
//! always do is answer honestly about itself.
