//! The owned codec ticket — one stream's `AVCodecParameters`, mirrored
//! into plain Rust and rebuilt on demand.
//!
//! # Why the mirror exists
//!
//! [`ffmpeg_next::codec::Parameters`] is a `*mut AVCodecParameters`
//! behind a `Send`-but-not-`Sync` wrapper. A track row that stores one
//! is `!Sync`, an `Arc` of that row is `!Send`, and every consumer that
//! shares a track table across tasks stops compiling — for a struct
//! FFmpeg documents as a plain *descriptor* with no thread affinity at
//! all. The auto-trait is missing, not the safety.
//!
//! The crate already answers that class one way: it mirrors what a
//! consumer needs into owned Rust —
//! [`TrackParams`](mediadecode::demuxer::TrackParams) mirrors the
//! common seats, [`SideDataEntry`] mirrors a frame's metadata,
//! [`FfmpegBytes`] mirrors its pixels. [`CodecTicket`] walks that road
//! its last mile: **every** seat of an `AVCodecParameters`, held as
//! owned bytes and plain integers, with `Sync` arriving by
//! construction rather than by an `unsafe impl` over FFI.
//!
//! # The two halves
//!
//! * [`CodecTicket::mirror`] reads a live `AVCodecParameters` into the
//!   ticket. It is the only place that reads one.
//! * [`CodecTicket::rebuild`] allocates a fresh `AVCodecParameters` and
//!   writes every seat back. It is the only place in this crate's
//!   track-row road that allocates one, and what it hands back is what
//!   `avcodec_parameters_to_context` is fed — unchanged from before the
//!   mirror existed.
//!
//! The pair is proved in `tests/codec_ticket_parity.rs`: for every
//! stream of every fixture the corpus can mint, the rebuilt struct is
//! compared with the original **field by field**, including
//! `extradata` bytes, the `AV_INPUT_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE` zeroes past
//! their end, every `coded_side_data` entry's type id and payload, and
//! the channel layout down to a custom map's per-channel names. The
//! shapes no container will hand over — a custom map, an unnamed
//! side-data kind, every scalar set off its default — are built by
//! hand in the same file, and a decoder is opened through a rebuilt
//! ticket and made to produce a frame.
//!
//! # The reading discipline, inherited
//!
//! Not one bindgen enum is materialised out of FFmpeg memory. Every
//! open C enum seat — the media type, the codec id, the field order,
//! the five colour seats, the alpha mode, the channel order, a custom
//! channel's id, a side-data type id — travels as **the raw 32-bit
//! pattern it is on the wire**, read and written through the same
//! `i32` cast, so a value this build's bindings cannot name is still a
//! value this ticket carries. That is the same rule
//! [`crate::extras::bounded_clone_parameters`] is written to, for the
//! same reason: forming a typed reference to a struct whose enum field
//! holds an unnamed discriminant is undefined behaviour before a
//! single field is read.
//!
//! [`SideDataEntry`]: crate::extras::SideDataEntry
//! [`FfmpegBytes`]: crate::FfmpegBytes
