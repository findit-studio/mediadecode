//! `mediadecode::VideoStreamDecoder` impl over FFmpeg's hardware and
//! software decoders.
//!
//! [`FfmpegVideoStreamDecoder`] opens on the [`DecodePath`] it is given:
//!
//! * **`Auto`** — what `open` does — probes the platform's hardware
//!   backends in order through [`crate::VideoDecoder`]. When none of them
//!   takes the stream before its first picture, it falls back to a
//!   **software** `ffmpeg::decoder::Video` opened from the same
//!   `Parameters`, and that fallback is lossless: the probe keeps every
//!   packet it consumed and hands them back in
//!   [`AllBackendsFailed`](crate::Error::AllBackendsFailed), and they are
//!   replayed into the software decoder — then the packet the probe
//!   refused — before anything else, so a non-seekable input loses
//!   nothing. A probe that exhausts at `open` opens software at once.
//! * **`AnyHardware`** is the same probe with software taken away: when no
//!   backend takes the stream before its first picture, the session
//!   reports [`AllBackendsFailed`](crate::Error::AllBackendsFailed) with
//!   the packets the probe took (none, when no backend opens at all), and
//!   the caller decides what to replay them into.
//! * **`Hardware(b)`** is that one backend or nothing, committed at open.
//! * **`Software`** is libavcodec's own decoder, with no probe.
//!
//! # After the first picture, nothing changes the road
//!
//! Once a backend has committed — at its first picture, or at open when
//! it was named — the session stays on it, and nothing is classified.
//! Every decoder failure ([`VideoDecodeError::Decode`]) is that picture's
//! own error, reported as it was minted, and nothing of it is remembered,
//! so the next call reaches libavcodec. Whether a hardware session
//! recovers is FFmpeg's: after a VideoToolbox restart that fails, every
//! picture fails the same way until a new parameter set re-arms the
//! restart, and `flush` rebuilds no hardware session (see
//! [`crate::VideoDecoder`] for the lines). This wrapper neither waits for
//! a recovery nor rules one out.
//!
//! A [`VideoDecodeError::Convert`] is this wrapper's own failure to
//! convert a decoded picture into a frame, not the decoder's. One that
//! failed on an allocation parks the picture, and until a `receive_frame`
//! delivers it, `send_packet` and `send_eof` answer `Sent::MustDrain`
//! without reaching libavcodec: back pressure, not a failure.
//!
//! **`Auto` does not go on in software at that point.** A software
//! decoder that starts mid-stream holds no reference pictures, and after
//! the first picture this session keeps no packets to give it, so it
//! cannot switch without a gap. Whether to switch, and what gap to
//! accept, is the caller's: it sees the failures and what it has
//! delivered, and it decides what to keep. [`DecodePath`] describes the
//! simplest policy.
//!
//! Frames produced by either decoder are converted via
//! [`crate::convert::av_frame_to_video_frame`] so the consumer sees the
//! same `mediadecode::VideoFrame<PixelFormat, VideoFrameExtra,
//! FfmpegBytes>` shape regardless of which backend produced it.

///   replayed into it. After it, the decoder that produced it.
/// - [`AnyHardware`](Self::AnyHardware): the same probe, and never

///   After the first picture, the backend that produced it.

///   probe, before and after.
/// - [`Hardware(b)`](Self::Hardware), the pin: backend `b`, committed at
///   open; nothing else is tried, before or after.
///
/// **After the first picture nothing changes the road, on any path, and
/// nothing is classified.** A decoder failure
/// ([`VideoDecodeError::Decode`]) is that picture's own error, reported as
/// it was minted, and nothing of it is remembered, so the next call
/// reaches libavcodec. Whether a hardware session recovers is FFmpeg's:
/// after a VideoToolbox restart that fails, every picture fails the same
/// way until a new parameter set re-arms the restart, and `flush` rebuilds
/// no hardware session. See [`VideoDecoder`](crate::VideoDecoder) for the
/// lines.
///
/// # When to stop trusting a hardware session
///
/// A caller that sees a hardware session's decoder failures persist
/// rebuilds: it opens a session on [`Software`](Self::Software) from the
/// same parameters and feeds it forward. When to do so is the caller's
/// policy, not this crate's, because it is the caller that sees the
/// failures on all three roads, the packets' key flags and what it has
/// delivered. What the new session can be fed depends on the road the
/// failure came from:
///
/// - **`send_packet`**: the failure names the packet in hand, and the new
///   session is given that packet.
/// - **`receive_frame`**: the failure may concern a packet accepted
///   earlier. FFmpeg decouples input from output and may hold several
///   pictures (`libavcodec/avcodec.h` 90–139 in FFmpeg 9.0.1), so no
///   packet is named: the new session is given the next packet, and the
///   caller accepts the gap.
/// - **`send_eof`**: the end has no packet to give a new session. What
///   the hardware session still held is recoverable only from packets
///   kept from before, or by a seek.
///
/// What a policy counts is the hardware session's decoder failures,
/// [`VideoDecodeError::Decode`]. A [`VideoDecodeError::Convert`] is this
/// wrapper's own: a decoded picture it could not convert into a frame (a
/// frame ceiling, a pixel format or plane layout it cannot carry, an
/// allocation). It is reported, not counted. One that failed on an
/// allocation parks the picture: the next `receive_frame` converts it
/// again, and until one delivers it `send_packet` and `send_eof` answer
/// [`Sent::MustDrain`] without reaching libavcodec. That is the wrapper's
/// back pressure, not a failure.
///
/// The example in the [crate documentation](crate) is the simplest such
/// policy:
///
/// - It counts the hardware session's decoder failures from all three
///   roads, and only a delivered picture ends the count.
/// - At a threshold of its own it opens [`Software`](Self::Software) from
///   the same parameters and feeds it forward, road by road as above.
///   Every picture the new session delivers is delivered as it is.
/// - On software its failures are reported and the stream goes on:
///   software is where the policy ends.
///
/// It keeps no packets, so the pictures from a failure to the next
/// keyframe are lost: the new session holds no reference pictures, and
/// libavcodec drops or conceals what comes before one. A caller that
/// cannot afford that gap keeps packets and replays them with a picture
/// identity of its own; that bookkeeping is the caller's design, and the
/// example does not show it.
///
/// The words differ in what they **permit**, not only where they start.
/// That is the difference the consumers of this door need. A determinism
/// comparison decodes *one stream* both ways and compares the pixels; a
/// run that silently swapped paths halfway would compare nothing and say
/// it had. An operator turning hardware off for a lane over a driver that
/// produces wrong pixels needs it to stay off. And a node that sends
/// hardware and software sessions to separate pools needs a hardware
/// session that never quietly becomes a software one — which is what
/// [`AnyHardware`](Self::AnyHardware) is for.
///
/// # Observability
///
/// [`is_hardware`](CarrierVideoStreamDecoder::is_hardware) and
/// [`is_software`](CarrierVideoStreamDecoder::is_software) read where a
/// session **is**, which stays a live reading — under
/// [`Auto`](Self::Auto) it can change once, during the probe, and under
/// the others it answers what was chosen because nothing can move it.
///
/// This type deliberately grows **no** `is_*` predicates of its own,
/// where most vocabularies in this crate do. They would spell the
/// decoder's two questions a second time with a different meaning —
/// `path.is_software()` is *what was asked for* and
/// `decoder.is_software()` is *where it ended up*, and under

  ///
  /// 1. **Narrow codec coverage.** `lowres` is wired only into the
  ///    legacy MPEG-family decoders (MPEG-1/2/4 part 2, H.263) that
  ///    still carry the low-resolution IDCT machinery it depends on.
  ///    HEVC, AV1 and VP9 — the codecs a modern HDR pipeline actually
  ///    decodes — implement no `lowres` support at all.
  /// 2. **The one codec that is wired is broken.** `lowres` on H.264
  ///    (also nominally covered) has been non-functional for years —
  ///    the decoder does not honor it correctly — so even the "old
  ///    family" half of the promise does not hold across the board.
  /// 3. **It is not a resize, it is reduced reconstruction.** Where it
  ///    does work, `lowres` decodes at a coarser IDCT precision
  ///    (`1<<lowres`), skipping reconstruction detail rather than
  ///    decoding in full and scaling the result — later inter frames
  ///    drift from a reference the decoder itself degraded, which is a
  ///    different (and worse) contract than "the same picture, smaller".
  ///
  /// So the software road's answer is not "unimplemented" the way the
  /// other hardware backends' is — it is "full-size decode, then the
  /// fused conform walk downstream", by design, on every codec this
