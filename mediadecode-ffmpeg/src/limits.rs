//! Resource ceilings — the finite budgets every copy across the FFmpeg
//! boundary is checked against **before** it allocates.
//!
//! These seats are tier one and tier two of the [resource governance
//! contract][gov]: what this crate allocates itself, and the FFmpeg
//! knobs it sets on the caller's behalf. The contract also states what
//! they do **not** bound, and what a deployment needing a hard memory
//! bound puts underneath them — read it before sizing these for a
//! hostile-input service.
//!
//! # Why these exist
//!
//! 0.9 made every exit copy (see [the amputation contract][law]). A copy
//! is a decision to allocate whatever the file asks for, and a container
//! is untrusted input: a header claiming 100000×100000 pixels, a packet
//! claiming a gigabyte, a Matroska with a thousand attached "fonts" all
//! cost nothing to write and everything to honour. Through 0.8 the
//! frame and packet payloads were *views*, so an absurd claim cost a
//! refcount; from 0.9 it costs memory, and the claim has to be judged
//! before it is paid.
//!
//! Every seat here is a **finite default**, not an `Option`. There is no
//! "unlimited" spelling on purpose: the shape that lets a caller ask for
//! no ceiling is the shape a caller reaches for once, in a hurry, and
//! never revisits. A caller who needs more says how much more.
//!
//! # Two layers, one number
//!
//! [`FrameLimits::max_pixels`] is enforced twice: once here, against the
//! frame this crate is about to copy, and once inside libavcodec, by
//! writing the same number to `AVCodecContext.max_pixels` when a decoder
//! is opened. The second is the one that matters most — it makes the
//! decoder refuse before allocating *its* huge frame, which this crate
//! would otherwise only get to reject after FFmpeg had already paid for
//! it.
//!
//! # The house shape
//!
//! `DEFAULT_*` consts, `Copy` options structs with `new` / getters /
//! `with_*` / `set_*`, and a `with_*` seat on each session — the same
//! shape [`crate::VideoDecoder::with_max_probe_pending_bytes`] and its
//! [`DEFAULT_MAX_PROBE_PENDING_BYTES`](crate::decoder::DEFAULT_MAX_PROBE_PENDING_BYTES)
//! already established for the probe-replay budget.

  /// entrypoint sets before the open, and, on the reader entrypoint, as
  /// a hard byte meter on the `AVIOContext` itself: past the budget the
  /// reader answers an I/O error, so the parser gets nothing more
  /// whatever it asks for.
  ///
  /// **Not bounded:** allocation *amplification* inside a parser. A
  /// container can describe, in a handful of bytes, a structure whose
  /// in-memory form is much larger, and nothing outside libavformat can
  /// see that happen. What this seat guarantees is that the input to
  /// that amplification is finite and small; bounding its output is the
  /// substrate's own hardening territory, and FFmpeg has its own
  /// `max_streams` / `max_index_size` / `max_picture_buffer` seats for
  /// exactly that — [`Self::max_streams`] sets the first of them.
  ///
  /// **Not bounded on the path entrypoint:** the byte meter needs an
  /// `AVIOContext` this crate owns, and a path is opened by
  /// libavformat's own protocol layer. `probesize` and
  /// `formatprobesize` still apply there; the hard meter does not.
