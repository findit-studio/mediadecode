## [0.19.0] - 2026-10-15

### Added

- **The encoder-by-name catalogue**, the gate every FFmpeg encoder will
  be opened through: `lookup` checks a closed catalogue and the license
  gate without asking FFmpeg anything, and `encoder_by_name` then asks
  the linked libavcodec, answering an `Admitted` encoder or an
  `EncoderRefusal` by name.
- **The `gpl` feature, off by default.** Without it the GPL encoders
  (`libx264`, `libx264rgb`, `libx265`) are refused by name before
  libavcodec is asked for them. Linking a GPL FFmpeg makes a binary GPL
  whatever this feature says; the README states it.
- **The muxer**: `FfmpegMuxer` (view lane) and `FfmpegOwnedMuxer` (owned
  lane) implement `Muxer` over libavformat for any container it names
  (`ContainerName`). `open` takes the sink, the container, the track
  table with each track's `CodecTicket`, the chapters and the packet
  limits, refuses by name what the container cannot take
  (`MuxOpenError`) and reports what it drops (`MuxReport`, `Uncarried`).
  Matroska keeps attachments with their filename and MIME type, MP4 keeps
  cover art; the report follows each track's road, naming the flags an
  attachment loses in Matroska and the filename, MIME type, language and
  flags a cover loses in MP4. Writes judge presentation
  order on the counts libavformat is handed, and refuse a strict
  container's repeated decode time, and a time the stream cannot count —
  one that lands on `i64::MIN`, libavformat's no-timestamp value, among
  them — by the muxer's own name (`FfmpegMuxRefusal`, through
  `MuxError::Backend`), handing the packet back; faults name their stage
  (`MuxFault`), a sink's panic included.
- The encoders arrive in the following releases.
