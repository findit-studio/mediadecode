//! A valid timeline as OpenTimelineIO's object tree.
//!
//! Every object is written with its keys in the order OpenTimelineIO's own
//! writer uses: `OTIO_SCHEMA` first, then each base class's fields before
//! the derived class's.
//!
//! Every track is planned, then walked, then written. The plan counts every
//! child — each count written within ±2^53, the whole numbers an `f64` holds
//! exactly; a clip's source range in the first of its own rulers that writes
//! it, or else in the first ruler the timeline's operands are counted in
//! that does ([`source_plan`]); its medium's available range likewise, in the
//! first that holds it whole, its end with it ([`available_plan`]) — and the
//! walk, [`mod@derive`], forms what OpenTimelineIO derives from those counts,
//! in its own arithmetic, holding each: a source range's end among them,
//! which the plan leaves to the walk. Where the walk refuses a value, a
//! search ([`settle`]) writes the clips it is formed from in other rulers
//! that hold their source ranges — every ruler the timeline's own operands
//! are counted in, and the finest and the coarsest whole ones below a clip's
//! plan's — one clip one ruler at a time, and walks again; what no plan it
//! tries holds is refused, with the last walk's refusal and what the search
//! tried.
