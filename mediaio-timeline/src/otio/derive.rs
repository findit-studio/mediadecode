//! What OpenTimelineIO derives from the document the export writes, in
//! OpenTimelineIO's own arithmetic beside the exact counts, and the hold on
//! each value it derives.
//!
//! OpenTimelineIO keeps a time as a `RationalTime`: a value and a rate, both
//! `f64`. A sum or a difference of two is carried in the higher of their
//! rates — the operand at the lower rate is rescaled to it, `(value ·
//! new_rate) / rate`, two rounded operations, and the values are added
//! (`opentime/rationalTime.h` 70–75, 286–339). A range ends at its duration
//! plus its start rescaled to the duration's rate (`timeRange.h` 105–108),
//! and its last tick — `end_time_inclusive`, the time of the last frame with
//! data — is that end floored or less one tick, by a branch OpenTimelineIO
//! takes on its own doubles (`timeRange.h` 88–102; [`Time::end_inclusive`]).
//! Every range below is held at both ends. On that arithmetic:
//!
//! - a child's place on its track starts at zero **in that child's own
//!   rate** and adds the duration of every item before it
//!   (`opentimelineio/track.cpp` 51–92); a transition starts its
//!   `in_offset` earlier;
//! - walking a whole track carries one running end, rescaled into each
//!   item's rate in turn (`track.cpp` 221–271);
//! - a track's duration starts at zero at rate 1 and adds every item
//!   (`track.cpp` 117–148), and the track's range runs it from zero in its
//!   rate — the range the stack gives the track too (`stack.cpp` 41–62); the
//!   stack's is the longest track's, picked by comparing `value / rate` in
//!   `f64`, the first of two that compare equal (`stack.cpp` 118–134,
//!   `rationalTime.h` 348–371), so the stack's range is the picked track's;
//! - a child's place in the timeline adds the stack's start of its track:
//!   zero, in the track's duration rate (`composition.cpp` 320–368,
//!   `stack.cpp` 41–62, `timeline.h` 69–74);
//! - an item beside a transition is visible over its source range widened by
//!   the transition's handles (`item.cpp` 60–85, `track.cpp` 150–165);
//! - an absolute time adds the global start to a place, with `operator+`,
//!   or runs a range of the timeline's duration from it — how
//!   OpenTimelineIO's own tools read one: toucan (`TimelineWrapper.cpp`
//!   319–324), raven (`app.cpp` 1315–1318), the FCP XML adapter
//!   (`fcp_xml.py` 2029–2032) and the Unreal plugin (`util.py` 93–106).
//!   OpenTimelineIO's core adds the global start to nothing itself
//!   (`timeline.h` 50–66).
//!
//! [`Time`] is a `RationalTime` computed operation for operation as
//! OpenTimelineIO computes it, beside the time it stands for, exactly
//! (`mediatime`'s [`ExactSeconds`]). Every value the walk forms is held
//! ([`Time::hold`]): within ±2^53 in the ruler OpenTimelineIO carries it in,
//! where an `f64` holds every whole count, and OpenTimelineIO's own double
//! less than half a tick from the exact count — read to the nearest tick, it
//! is the exact count. On one ruler, where nothing is rescaled, the sums are
//! of whole counts and the doubles are the counts themselves — so a range the
//! document writes in one ruler, its start and duration whole and its end
//! within ±2^53, also ends inclusively where it exactly does: its duration is
//! whole, it takes the less-one branch exactly when it is longer than one
//! tick, and every sum on the way is exact. The source, available and gap
//! ranges the export writes are such ranges.
//!
//! The lines cited are OpenTimelineIO's `main` at `00c22fa` (2026-10-09),
//! and the tools' heads of the same day.
