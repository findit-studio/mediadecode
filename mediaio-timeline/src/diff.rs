/// What changed from `before` to `after`, clip by clip, per track.
///
/// Tracks are matched by index, and within a track a clip by its
/// [`id`](Clip::id) alone: a clip renamed, or pointed at another medium,
/// keeps its id and is the same clip, while two placements of one medium —
/// a cut back to a shot — are two clips. A clip that changes track is
/// removed from one and added to the other.
///
/// An id names one clip of a timeline. A side that carries one twice is
/// refused with [`Ambiguous`] rather than matched by occurrence, which would
/// report a clip that stayed put as moved and one that stayed as removed;
/// [`validate`](fn@crate::validate) refuses such a timeline too
/// ([`Refusal::DuplicateClipId`](crate::Refusal::DuplicateClipId)).
///
/// A clip only in `after` is [`Added`](ChangeKind::Added); one only in
/// `before` is [`Removed`](ChangeKind::Removed). A clip in both is reported
/// once for each way it changed:
///
/// - [`Moved`](ChangeKind::Moved) — its record covers a different stretch
///   of the timeline. Positions are explicit, so a clip moves only when its
///   own record changed, never because a clip before it was trimmed;
/// - [`Retimed`](ChangeKind::Retimed) — its source range covers a different
///   stretch of its medium;
/// - [`Regained`](ChangeKind::Regained) — its gain or its fades changed;
/// - [`EnabledFlipped`](ChangeKind::EnabledFlipped) — it was enabled and is
///   disabled, or the other way round;
/// - [`Renamed`](ChangeKind::Renamed) — its name changed;
/// - [`Relinked`](ChangeKind::Relinked) — its medium's locator changed: it
///   reads another medium.
///
/// Ranges and lengths compare by the time they cover, so a range recounted
/// in another timebase over the same instants is not a change.
///
/// The changes come in a fixed order: by track, then by where the clip sits
/// — its record in `after`, or in `before` for a removed clip — then by kind
/// in the order above, then by index. So `diff(a, a)` is empty for every `a`
/// it answers, and every run over the same pair answers the same list.
///
/// Only clips are compared. The timeline's own words (name, rate, start,
/// notes), a track's words (kind, name, enabled), transitions, a clip's
/// notes and its medium's words other than the locator are not.
